## How to run the project

1. Go to the GitHub repository that contains the Colab notebook you want to run.

2. Copy the URL of the notebook file. For example, if the notebook is located at `https://github.com/Dept-of-Comp-Sci-University-of-Ghana/mid-sem-hackthon-group-2.git`, copy that URL.

3. Go to Google Colab (colab.research.google.com).

4. Click the "GitHub" tab on the Colab homepage.

5. Paste the URL of the notebook file you copied in step 2 into the text box, then click "Enter".

6. Colab will now load the notebook from the GitHub repository and you can run the cells in the notebook.

That's it! The key steps are:

1. Copy the notebook URL from GitHub
2. Go to Colab and select the "GitHub" option
3. Paste the notebook URL and Colab will load it
